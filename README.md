Methods to assess the creditworthiness of loan applicants is necessary for the profitability of the banks or lending sources. With the number of loans being given, for a typical lending institution even a slight improvement in credit scoring model can translate to significant profits. This motivates in development of advanced and sophisticated models to discriminate good and bad borrowers.
This project aims at comparing few of the classification algorithms based on their performance to classify in such a scenario. The German Credit data set from the UCI data set repository is being used for this purpose. The data set classifies people described by a set of attributes as good or bad credit risk. The objective is to develop models that will classify any incoming person into one of these two categories based on their attributes with a reasonable good accuracy value.
Different approaches to the problem is evaluated such as parametric (Na√Øve Bayes) and non-parametric methods (Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors). In addition to this even ensemble of classifiers (Random Forest, Boosting) is evaluated for improvement in performance.
